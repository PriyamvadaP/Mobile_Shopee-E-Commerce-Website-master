## Introduction
The College Bazaar is a database management system project developed primarily for college students to facilitate the reselling of used items for college purposes. This web-based platform connects student sellers and buyers, providing a convenient way for students to access a wide range of college-related products. Sellers can register, list their items, and receive feedback from administrators regarding their application status. Only administrators have the authority to print a list of items, detailing who purchased each product and the seller's information. The system follows a Structured System Analysis and Design methodology to ensure efficient operation.

## Features
- **User Roles**: The system distinguishes between customers (students looking to buy) and sellers (students looking to sell), each with specific functionalities.
- **Registration and Authentication**: Users can register and log in securely, ensuring a safe and personalized experience.
- **Product Listing**: Sellers can easily list their items for sale, including product details and pricing.
- **Application Processing**: Administrators review and approve seller applications, providing feedback on the status.
- **Transaction History**: The system maintains transaction records, allowing users to track their purchases and sales.
- **Expense Reduction**: The College Bazaar helps students reduce monthly or yearly expenses by facilitating the exchange of used college-related items.

## Problem Statement
**Challenge 1: Efficient Utilization of Graduating Students' Assets**
- When students graduate, they often leave behind valuable assets, such as textbooks, bicycles, and other college-related items, which are left unused or discarded.
- The lack of a structured system to manage and redistribute these assets results in waste and missed opportunities for incoming students to acquire them at lower costs.

**Challenge 2: Connecting Students within the College Community**
- Students within a college community often miss out on opportunities to connect and build relationships with their peers due to the absence of a centralized platform.
- There is a need for a platform that not only allows students to trade items but also promotes interaction and networking among students from different batches.

**Challenge 3: Inefficient Information Flow**
- Currently, information about available used items is primarily shared through informal channels, limiting the reach and accessibility of such opportunities.
- The absence of a structured platform leads to confusion and missed connections among students looking for specific items.

## Technologies Used
The College Bazaar is developed using the following technologies and tools:
- **HTML**: Used for creating the structure of web pages.
- **CSS**: Employed for styling and design.
- **JavaScript**: Added for interactive features and enhanced user experience.
- **PHP**: Utilized for server-side scripting and backend logic.
- **MySQL**: The database management system used for storing and retrieving data.
